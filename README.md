# Determining Car Pricing Via Machine Learning

This project represented the capstone of the Introduction to Statistical Machine Learning course I took at the University of California, Santa Barbara from September to December 2022. After learning and applying various machine learning techniques, I set out to try and accurately predict the asking price of a particular vehicle given available data such as manufacturer, mileage, color, etc. The project compared the performance of a lasso regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machine against one another to determine which model was able to best predict vehicle price.
